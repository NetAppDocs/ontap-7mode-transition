Before entering the cutover phase for AIX hosts with FC or FCoE configurations, you must perform specific steps.

Fabric connectivity and zoning to the clustered Data ONTAP nodes must be established.

For copy-based transitions, perform these steps after completing the Storage Cutover operation in the 7-Mode Transition Tool. Copy-free transitions are not supported on AIX hosts.

. Shut down your host: `shutdown -h`
