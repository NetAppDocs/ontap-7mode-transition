Snapshots virtual machines (VMs) with Virtual RDM attached do not survive transition from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode to clustered Data ONTAP. These snapshots must be removed before transition. Snapshots of VMs with only VMFS vDisks and Physical RDM (PTRDM) do survive transition and do not have to be removed.

You can use the _Inventory Assessment Workbook_ generated by the Inventory Collect Tool to identify all VMs with Virtual RDMs attached. Snapshots listed in the _Inventory Assessment Workbook_ under the VM Snapshots column and the NPTRDM column with a value greater than 0 are VMs that have a Virtual RDM attached with VM snapshots.
