If your ONTAP LUNs are not performing as you expect after transition from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode, you can rollback from ONTAP to 7-Mode LUNs on a Windows host.

Your 7-Mode LUNs must be remapped to your host.

.Steps
. Use Hyper-V Manager to shut down all virtual machines (VMs) running on the LUNs.
. Use Windows Disk Manager to take the LUNs offline.
. Use Cluster Disk Manager to take the cluster disks offline.
. Shut down the host.
. Revert back to Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode.
. Boot the host.
. Use Windows Disk Manager to bring your 7-Mode LUNs online.
. Use Cluster Disk Manager to bring cluster disks online.
. Use Hyper-V Manager to bring your VMs online.
