If your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 LUN is configured with a device mapper multipath (DMMP), you should verify that a file system is not configured before you transition the LUN from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode to clustered Data ONTAP.

.Steps
. Locate the SCSI device name for the LUN to be transitioned:
+
`*sanlun lunshow*`
. Identify the DMMP device name for the LUN:
+
`*multipath -11*`
+
The DMMP device name can be a device handle ID (WWID) such as `360a980003753456258244538554b4b53`, or it can be an alias, such as, `dmmp_raw_lun`.

. Verify that the LUN does not have a file system:
+
`*dumpe2fs/dev/mapper/__DMMP device name__*`
+
If the LUN does not have a file system, Couldn't find valid filesystem superblock is displayed in the output.
