You should be aware of certain exceptions and known issues when transitioning SAN hosts from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode to later versions of ONTAP.

* For transitioning Hyper-Virtual Machine (VMs) with only VHD or VHDX file types, you can use storage live migration instead of the 7-Mode Transition Tool (7MTT).
+
For details about Hyper-V storage live migration, see the Microsoft documentation.

* If you used the same igroup name on both nodes of the 7-Mode controller, the transition tool might fail to resolve the igroup conflict.
