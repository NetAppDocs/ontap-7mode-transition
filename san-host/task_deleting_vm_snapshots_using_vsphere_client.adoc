If you are not familiar with the ESXi CLI or if it is more convenient for your environment, you can delete Virtual Machine (VM) snapshots using vSphere Client.

* For copy-based transitions, perform these steps before initiating the Storage Cutover operation in the 7-Mode Transition Tool (7MTT).
* For copy-free transitions, perform these steps before initiating the Export & Halt 7-Mode Systems operation in the 7MTT.

.Steps
. Open the ESXi host or vCenter Server managing the ESXi host.
. Right-click the VM from which you need to remove snapshots.
. Open the *Snapshot* > *Snapshot Manager* Snapshots window.
. Click *Delete All*.
