[.lead]
If your Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 or RHEL 6 LUN is configured with a device mapper multipath (DMMP), you should verify that a file system is not configured before you transition the LUN from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode to clustered Data ONTAP.

This procedure applies to copy-based transitions and copy-free transitions.

.Steps
. Gather pretransition information from the _Inventory Assessment Workbook_.
. Check whether the DMMP device entry is present under the *SAN Host File system* tab.
+
If the DMMP device entry is not present, a file system is not configured and you can transition the LUN.
