Linux and Windows guest operating systems might require additional remediation after transition of LUNs from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode to clustered Data ONTAP.

For copy-based transitions, do the following after completing the Storage Cutover operation in the 7MTT. For copy-free transitions, do the following after the Import Data & Configuration operation in the 7MTT is complete.

* Linux
+
If the mount points are defined in the /etc/fstab file, you must mount the LUN (mount --a).

* Windows
+
If Failover Cluster is configured on the VM, you must bring the disks online from Failover Cluster Manager.
