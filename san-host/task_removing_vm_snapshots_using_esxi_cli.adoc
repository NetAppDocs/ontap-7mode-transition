You can choose to use the ESXi CLI to remove the snapshots if you are using the Host Remediation Tool (HRT), or if you prefer the flexibility of CLI usage.

You must have the VMID from the Host VMs tab in the _Inventory Assessment Workbook_ generated by the 7-Mode Transition Tool (7MTT).

. Use SSH to log in to the ESXi console.
. Remove all VM snapshots of the VM with the applicable VMID: `# vim-cmd vmsvc/snapshot.removeall VMID`

After deleting snapshots, you must regenerate the _Inventory Assessment Workbook_ to collect information related to Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode and your ESXi hosts.
