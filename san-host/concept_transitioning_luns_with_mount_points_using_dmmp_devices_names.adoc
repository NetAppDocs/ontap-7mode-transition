Before transitioning a LUN with a mount point using a DMMP device name, you must replace the DMMP device name with its corresponding file system UUID number. You must perform specific steps to prepare for the cutover phase and you must remount the DMMP devices on the host after transition. You perform the same procedures for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 5 and RHEL 6.
