Before you transition AIX host data LUNs with file systems from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode to clustered Data ONTAP, you must gather information you need for the transition process.

. On the 7-Mode controller, identify the name of the LUN to be transitioned: `lun show`
. On the host, locate the SCSI device name for the LUN: `sanlun lun show`
+
The SCSI device name is located in the device filename column.

. List and record the physical volumes used by the volume group configured in the data LUNs to be transitioned: `lsvg -p vg_name`
. List and record the logical volumes used by the volume group: `lsvg -l vg_name`
