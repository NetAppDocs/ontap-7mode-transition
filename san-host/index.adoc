If you are transitioning data and configurations from Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode to clustered Data ONTAP 8.3 or later using the 7-Mode Transition Tool (7MTT) 2.2 or later, you must perform remediation steps for SAN hosts before and after transition.

The _7-Mode Transition Tool SAN Host Transition and Remediation Guide_ provides the necessary pretransition and post-transition steps for VMware ESXi, Windows, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL), HP-UX, and AIX hosts.
