If you are not satisfied with the performance of your clustered Data ONTAP LUNs, you can rollback from clustered Data ONTAP to Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode for copy-free transitions (CFTs). Rollback is not supported for copy-based transitions (CBTs). Rollback is only supported on certain hosts.

You can rollback from clustered Data ONTAP to Data ONTAP operating in 7-Mode at any point before you click *commit* in the 7-Mode Transition Tool (7MTT). After you click *commit*, you cannot rollback.

The following hosts support rollback:

* Windows
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL)
* ESXi

The following hosts do not support rollback:

* HP-UX
* AIX
