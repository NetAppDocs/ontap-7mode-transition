The 7-Mode Transition Tool supports the transition of stand-alone SnapLock Enterprise volumes and SnapLock Enterprise volumes that are in a SnapMirror relationship.

The workflow for transitioning SnapLock Enterprise volumes is the same as for FlexVol volumes.

SnapMirror relationships are preserved during the transition.

NOTE: The 7-Mode Transition Tool only supports like-to-like transition for SnapMirror relationships of SnapLock Enterprise volumes. That is, both the source and destination volumes must be SnapLock Enterprise volumes.
