If NFS is licensed and NFS service is running on the systems operating in 7-Mode, you must manually prepare the cluster and target SVM for transitioning NFS configurations. You must also be aware of what configurations are transitioned.

Some NFS configurations operating in 7-Mode are not supported in ONTAP. Some configurations are not transitioned by the 7-Mode Transition Tool and must be manually applied to the SVM.
