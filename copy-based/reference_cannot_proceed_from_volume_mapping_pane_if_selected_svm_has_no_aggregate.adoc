The tool displays an error message, `SVM does not have aggregate assigned. Please assign some aggregates to the SVM and click on the refresh button`, on the *Volume mapping* pane if the selected SVM has no aggregate other than the root node aggregate.

== Workaround

Add an aggregate to the SVM in clustered Data ONTAP.
