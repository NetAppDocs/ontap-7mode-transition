You can add, edit, or remove 7-Mode IP addresses from a project.

The LIFs are configured on the storage virtual machine (SVM) in the apply configuration (precutover) phase:

* Existing 7-Mode IP addresses are created in the administrative "`down`" state.
* New IP addresses are created in the administrative "`up`" state.

IMPORTANT: FC and iSCSI LIFs are not transitioned by the 7-Mode Transition Tool.

. Perform one of the following actions:
