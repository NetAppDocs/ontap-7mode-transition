You can edit a project to add or remove volumes, and to modify the transition configurations.

* You must have created a project.
* You must not have started the project that you want to edit.

You can edit a project to change the volumes that are selected for transition. You can also edit a project to change the SVM mapping, volume mapping, and interface mapping, as well as the data copy schedule. You cannot change the project type or the vFiler unit when editing a project.

. From the Dashboard window, select the project that you want to edit.
. Click *Edit Project*, and then select the required step from the drop-down list.
. Complete the wizard to edit your project.
