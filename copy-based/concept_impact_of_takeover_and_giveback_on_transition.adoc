[.lead]
Transition operations, such as transition prepare, start, pause, resume, or complete, fail during a controller takeover or giveback.

If a transition operation fails due to a takeover, you must wait for the giveback to finish, and then run the transition operation again.

If a controller takeover occurs during a baseline transfer, the transfer fails. To resume the baseline transfer from the point where it was aborted, you must wait for the giveback to finish.

Data copy resumes based on the configured schedule.
