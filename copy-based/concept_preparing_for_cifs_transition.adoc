If SMB/CIFS is licensed and SMB/CIFS service is running on the 7-Mode systems, you must manually perform some tasks, such as adding the SMB/CIFS license and creating a SMB/CIFS server, on the target cluster and SVM for transitioning SMB/CIFS configurations.

You must also be aware of what configurations are transitioned. Some SMB/CIFS configurations operating in 7-Mode are not supported in ONTAP. Some configurations are not transitioned by the 7-Mode Transition Tool and must be manually applied to the SVM.
