Transition operations, such as transition prepare, start, pause, resume, or complete, fail during a MetroCluster switchover or after a MetroCluster switchback. You must then manually reestablish the SnapMirror relationships to resume transition.

. Wait for the switchback to complete.
. From the cluster CLI, use the snapmirror create command to reestablish the SnapMirror relationships between the 7-Mode volumes and clustered Data ONTAP volumes that were part of the transition.
. From the 7-Mode Transition Tool, rerun the transition operation.
+
Data copy operations start when the next schedule becomes active.
