You can remove the failed volumes from a project during the transition process and abort a volume SnapMirror relationship.

If a volume is removed when the data copy is in progress, then the transfer is not aborted and continues until the operation is completed. The volume is not considered for any further data copy operations.

. From the Dashboard window, select a project, and then click Volumes.
+
All of the existing volumes for the project are displayed.

. Click image:../media/delete_schedule.gif[].
+
The volume is removed from the project.

The best practice is to delete the ONTAP volumes and release the SnapMirror relationships.

. From the cluster, delete the ONTAP volumes that are created as part of the transition.

. From the 7-Mode system, release the SnapMirror relationships to the ONTAP volumes.
. If you abort a volume SnapMirror relationship, perform the following steps:
 .. Break and delete the SnapMirror relationship between the 7-Mode primary volumes and ONTAP secondary volumes.
 .. From the primary 7-Mode system, release the SnapMirror relationships to the ONTAP secondary volumes.
