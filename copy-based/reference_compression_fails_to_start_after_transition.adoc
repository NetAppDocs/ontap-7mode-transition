If you transition a 32-bit volume on a system running Data ONTAP 7.3.x to an ONTAP volume that is in a 64-bit aggregate, compression is not enabled on the ONTAP volume after the transition. Compression cannot be enabled until the volume is upgraded from 32-bit to 64-bit.

== Workaround

. Wait for the upgrade to finish.
+
You can use the volume show -fields block-type -volumevol_name command to verify that the block type of the volume changes to 64-bit.

. Enable compression by using the volume efficiency modify command.
