You cannot select a secondary volume from the Volume selection pane and transition it as a volume SnapMirror relationship if the volume is not online or if the SnapMirror relationship is broken.

== Workaround

Use the ONTAP command-line to perform either of the following workarounds:

* Bring the secondary volume online if it is offline.
* Fix the SnapMirror relationship if it is broken.
