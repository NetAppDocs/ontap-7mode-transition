The 7-Mode Transition Tool provides commands that enable you to transition 7-Mode volumes. If you have the 7-Mode Transition Tool installed on a Linux system, you must use the CLI to perform the transition.

The tool collects the 7-Mode storage system's volume and IP address information, verifies the 7-Mode configuration, and interacts with the cluster to apply the configuration on the SVM.
