After completing the transition, you must configure the zones by using the FC zone plan to group the initiator hosts and targets for providing data access from the cluster.

* The cluster and initiator hosts must be connected to the switch.
* The FC zone script file must be accessible.

. Log in to the CLI of the switch.
. Copy and execute the required zone commands one at a time.
+
The following example runs the zone commands on the switch:
+
----
switch1:admin>config terminal
# Enable NPIV feature
feature npiv
zone name auto_transition_igroup_d31_194bf3 vsan 10
member pwwn 21:00:00:c0:dd:19:4b:f3
member pwwn 20:07:00:a0:98:32:99:07
member pwwn 20:09:00:a0:98:32:99:07
.......
.......
.......
copy running-config startup-config

The initiator hosts can access data from the cluster.
