Rollback refers to discontinuing the transition to ONTAP system and reverting to 7-Mode system. Transition rollback is manual; however, the 7-Mode Transition Tool provides the list of manual tasks you have to perform for a rollback.

You can roll back a transition project in the SVM provision, export, cabling, import, or preproduction testing phase. You cannot roll back after the transition project is committed.

Any new data written or modified, such as LUNs or LUN clones, in the transitioned volumes will be lost after a rollback. The volumes will be reverted to their original 7-Mode state.
