You can collect inventory information from controllers, hosts, and FC switches. You can then assess features and functionalities of these systems, and identify how these features and functionalities work in the ONTAP version that is selected for transition.

You can collect inventory information in two ways:

* If your environment security allows it, you can install the 7-Mode Transition Tool, and then use it to collect the inventory information.
* You can import the inventory XML report generated by the Inventory Collect Tool, and then perform the assessment.

In both cases, you must use Inventory Collect Tool 3.3 to collect the inventory.

To assess the inventory information for a copy-free transition, you must select both of the nodes of the source 7-Mode HA pair. Although the assessment is done on a per-node basis, if a single node is not qualified for transition, the entire HA pair cannot be transitioned.
