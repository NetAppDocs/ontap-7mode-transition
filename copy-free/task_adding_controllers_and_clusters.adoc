Before you start the transition, you must add the 7-Mode controllers, including both nodes of a 7-Mode HA pair, and the clusters that are required for the transition. You should add the clusters using the cluster-management interface.

* For a copy-free transition, you must add the cluster, and not the cluster nodes that are the target of transition.
* The 7-Mode controllers and clusters information that you provide is not persistent.
+
If the 7-Mode Transition Tool service is restarted, the tool prompts in the project dashboard for information about controllers and cluster that are part of active projects.

. From the top pane, click *Storage Systems*.
. In the *Hostname* field, enter the FQDN or IP address of the 7-Mode controller or the ONTAP system.
+
For a cluster, you can specify the IP address or FQDN of the cluster-management interface. For a 7-Mode controller, you must specify the IP address of the default vFiler unit, because the IP addresses of individual vFiler units are not accepted.

. Enter the administrator credentials for the specified host, and then click *Add*.
+
The 7-Mode controllers are added to the "`7-Mode Controllers`" table and clusters are added to the "`Clustered Data ONTAP Systems`" table.

. Repeat Steps 2 and 3 to add all of the controllers and clusters that you require for the transition.
. If the Status column indicates that the credentials of the system are missing or the credentials have changed from what was initially entered in the tool, click the image:../media/delete_me_edit_schedule.gif[] icon, and then enter the credentials again.
. Click *Next*.
+
The Select Source Systems screen is displayed.
