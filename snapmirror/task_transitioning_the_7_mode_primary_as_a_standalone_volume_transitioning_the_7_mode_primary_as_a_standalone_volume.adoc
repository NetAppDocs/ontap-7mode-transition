After the 7-Mode primary volume is back online after a disaster, you must transition the 7-Mode primary volume. Because all SnapMirror relationships to the 7-Mode primary volume are broken and deleted at this stage, you can transition a stand-alone volume for this type of transition.

. Copy data from the 7-Mode volume to the clustered Data ONTAP volume:
 .. If you want to configure the TCP window size for the SnapMirror relationship between the 7-Mode system and the SVM, create a SnapMirror policy of type async-mirror with the window-size-for-tdp-mirror option.
+
You must then apply this policy to the TDP SnapMirror relationship between the 7-Mode system and the SVM.
+
You can configure the TCP window size in the range of 256 KB to 7 MB for improving the SnapMirror transfer throughput so that the transition copy operations get completed faster. The default value of TCP window size is 2 MB.
+
----
cluster1::> snapmirror policy create -vserver vs1 â€“policy tdp_policy -window-size-for-tdp-mirror 5MB -type async-mirror
----

 .. Use the snapmirror create command with the relationship type as TDP to create a SnapMirror relationship between the 7-Mode system and the SVM.
+
If you have created a SnapMirror policy to configure the TCP window size, you must apply the policy to this SnapMirror relationship.

----
cluster1::> snapmirror create -source-path system7mode:dataVol20 -destination-path vs1:dst_vol -type TDP -policy tdp_policy
Operation succeeded: snapmirror create the relationship with destination vs1:dst_vol.
----

 .. Use the snapmirror initialize command to start the baseline transfer.
+
----
cluster1::> snapmirror initialize -destination-path vs1:dst_vol
Operation is queued: snapmirror initialize of destination vs1:dst_vol.
----

. If you have a schedule for incremental transfers, perform the following steps when you are ready to perform cutover:
 .. Use the snapmirror quiesce command to disable all future update transfers.
+
----
cluster1::> snapmirror quiesce -destination-path vs1:dst_vol
----

 .. Use the snapmirror modify command to delete the SnapMirror schedule.
+
----
cluster1::> snapmirror modify -destination-path vs1:dst_vol -schedule ""
----

 .. If you quiesced the SnapMirror transfers earlier, use the snapmirror resume command to enable SnapMirror transfers.
+
----
cluster1::> snapmirror resume -destination-path vs1:dst_vol
----
. Wait for any ongoing transfers between the 7-Mode volumes and the clustered Data ONTAP volumes to finish, and then disconnect client access from the 7-Mode volumes to start cutover.
. Use the snapmirror update command to perform a final data update to the clustered Data ONTAP volume.
+
----
cluster1::> snapmirror update -destination-path vs1:dst_vol
Operation is queued: snapmirror update of destination vs1:dst_vol.
----

. Use the snapmirror show command to verify that the last transfer was successful.
. Use the snapmirror break command to break the SnapMirror relationship between the 7-Mode volume and the clustered Data ONTAP volume.
+
----
cluster1::> snapmirror break -destination-path vs1:dst_vol
[Job 60] Job succeeded: SnapMirror Break Succeeded
----

. If your volumes have LUNs configured, at the advanced privilege level, use the lun transition 7-mode show command to verify that the LUNs were transitioned.
+
You can also use the lun show command on the clustered Data ONTAP volume to view all of the LUNs that were successfully transitioned.

. Use the snapmirror delete command to delete the SnapMirror relationship between the 7-Mode volume and the clustered Data ONTAP volume.
+
----
cluster1::> snapmirror delete -destination-path vs1:dst_vol
----

. Use the snapmirror release command to remove the SnapMirror relationship information from the 7-Mode system.
+
----
system7mode> snapmirror release dataVol20 vs1:dst_vol
----
